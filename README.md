The dataset used will be the following:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge

The objective of this project is to have a MLOPS simple workflow, where the objective is to predict a car price based on its attributes.

Tools used:
VS code, jupyter, docker desktop, anaconda prompt, mlflow, prefect and evidently.

To run evidently_metrics.py, start prefect and also docker-compose.yaml

The project still needs several additions, such as tests.

(At this stage of the project, recommendations are very welcome!!)
